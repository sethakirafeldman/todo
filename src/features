strike-through on task status === true, vice-versa
styling for sidebar
dynamic chevrons for projects in side bar
local storage to store user data
editable todos/projects 
deleteable todos/projects

it may be better to display project content on own 'page' rather than show all tasks in main window.
ie, multiple pages All Tasks, Project 1, completed, left-to-do, etc.
