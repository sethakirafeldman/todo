Features left to add 09/05/2021

strike-through on task status === true, vice-versa
styling for sidebar
dynamic chevrons for projects in side bar
local storage to store user data
editable todos/projects 
deleteable todos/projects
    deleting project Object poses issue unless
    project order shifts down to fill spot. 
    much of logic relies on order of tasks. 

it may be better to display project content on own 'page' rather than show all tasks in main window.
ie, multiple pages All Tasks, Project 1, completed, left-to-do, etc.
